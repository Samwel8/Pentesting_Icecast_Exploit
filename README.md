# Pentesting_Icecast_Exploit
GoodSecurity was tasked with performing an internal penetration test on GoodCorps CEO, Hans Gruber. An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems. 
The focus of this test is to perform attacks, similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate Hans computer and determine if it is at risk.
